## What are Lists?
Lists are a versatile data structure in programming, designed to hold a collection of elements with the flexibility to handle different data types. Unlike arrays, lists are dynamic, meaning their size can change during the execution of a program. This adaptability makes lists particularly useful for tasks involving the addition or removal of elements. Lists provide a convenient interface for developers to manage and organize data, allowing for efficient operations such as appending, inserting, or deleting elements. The ability to dynamically adjust their size makes lists a powerful tool for handling varying amounts of data in a program.

## What are Arrays?
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the array is identified by an index, representing its position. The key characteristic of arrays is that they offer quick and direct access to elements using these indices. They provide a systematic way to organize and manage data, making it efficient to retrieve, modify, and manipulate information stored in the array. Arrays are widely used in various programming languages for their simplicity and effectiveness in handling ordered sets of data.
