## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.  
This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.  
**It can be visualized as a pile of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate.**  

### Operations on Stack:
The primary operations associated with a stack are:

**Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
**Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  
**Peek (or Top):** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  
**IsEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.  
**Size:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.  

### Use Cases of Stack:  
Stacks are used in various applications, including:  

**Function Call Management:** The call stack in programming languages keeps track of function calls and returns.  
**Expression Evaluation:** Used in parsing expressions and evaluating postfix or prefix notations.  
**Backtracking:** Helps in algorithms that require exploring all possibilities, such as maze solving and depth-first search.
